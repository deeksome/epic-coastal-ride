# Image Organization Guide

Each folder corresponds to a specific day of the Epic Coastal Ride. Please organize your images as follows:

## Folder Structure
- `day1-benaulim/`: Bangalore to Benaulim Beach
  - Main cover image should be named `cover.jpg`
  - Additional images can be named descriptively (e.g., `chitradurga-fort.jpg`, `anmod-ghats.jpg`)

- `day2-murudeshwara/`: Benaulim to Murudeshwara
  - Main cover image: `cover.jpg`
  - Additional images for attractions

[... and so on for each day]

## Image Guidelines
1. **Cover Images**
   - Name: `cover.jpg`
   - Recommended size: 800x400 pixels
   - Used in the main itinerary cards

2. **Attraction Images**
   - Use descriptive names (e.g., `temple-entrance.jpg`, `beach-sunset.jpg`)
   - Keep file sizes optimized (recommend under 500KB per image)
   - Preferred format: JPG for photos, PNG for graphics

3. **Image Organization**
   - Each day's folder can contain multiple images
   - Name images descriptively based on the location or attraction
   - Include relevant metadata in image properties if possible

## Usage
The cover images are automatically used in the itinerary cards. You can add as many additional images as you like in each folder for your personal collection and documentation.
